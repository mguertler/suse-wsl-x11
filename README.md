Automatic X11 configuration for openSUSE Leap on WSL

WSL provides Linux compatibilty on Windows, implementing an POSIX API layer in the Windows kernel. Linux binaries can be executed after enabling WSL and installing one of the offered Linux distributions, like openSUSE Leap. X11 applications can run as well, when a X11 server like vcXsrv is present and running on the system.

This project project provides an automatic setup and configuration of a fully working X11 environment based on openSUSE Leap, vcXsrv, XFCE and many X11 applications.

Execute, run and have a lot of fun.
